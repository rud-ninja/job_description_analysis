 Team: Trading Data Science
 Salary range: £50,000 - 70,000
 Experience: Experienced
 Working pattern: Full-Time
 Reporting to: Dave Eagon - Trading Data Scientist Lead
 Sponsorship: Unfortunately we are unable to offer sponsorship for this role.
 This role in 3 words: Technical. Collaborative. Challenging.
 Top 3 qualities for this role: Smart. Cool-headed. Approachable.


 In the words of the team, you should leave your current role for this one because….
 ""You will be able to work on important problems, creating novel solutions, alongside other great people""


 Everyone belongs at OVO
 At OVO, we are on a mission to solve one of humanity's biggest challenges, the climate crisis. And we know it takes all of us to change the world. That's why we need diverse people from all gender identities, ethnicities, ages, sexual orientations, life experiences and backgrounds to join us.

 Teamworking for the planet
 Everything we do here spins around Plan Zero. So, naturally, the team you'll be joining plays a gigantic role in making that happen. Here's how:


 We are looking for the smartest people who want to work on the hardest problems. Our specialist data science team is collectively responsible for demand forecasting, forward curves, predictive modelling and advanced risk analytics.

 This role in a nutshell:


 You will help us develop, deploy and maintain world class models and deliver deep insights to drive success at OVO. You will bring skills, knowledge and experience which complement the existing team.


 Your key outcomes will be:

Supporting the core trading functions through demand forecasting and forward curve modelling. As part of the Data Science team you will become an expert in keeping these models running smoothly and creating incremental improvements
Developing new products to enhance our ability to effectively risk manage our trading book
Improving our data and data pipelines to ensure our models are seeing the most accurate picture of the world
Providing expertise to other teams to support our common goals

Within your first 6 months you'll:

Have a good understanding of our core functions
Be able to triage operational issues appropriately, resolving or escalating as required
Be playing an active role in long term development projects
Be able to represent Data Science in the wider team and beyond

You will already have:

3+ years of experience working as a data scientist / data engineer / similar role
Strong modelling and programming skills using Python (Pandas, NumPy & SciPy libraries)
Experience writing repeatable code using techniques like version control, testing and continuous deployment
Experience with production engineering technologies such as docker, GCP, linux and kubernetes



 Systems: Experience with Python, SQL, Git and Tableau is highly preferred. Experience with R, GCP, Airflow, Excel and PowerPoint (or Google equivalent) is desirable.


 You'll be a successful Data Scientist here at OVO if you…

Prioritise - you will be simultaneously working on high-value long-term projects and supporting our core trading operations. The ability to transition seamlessly between the two is essential
Find a way - being on the cutting edge means there is often no path to follow. You will be able to find a way of getting things done, asking for help when needed and plotting a route through complexity
Support - we work together with a wider team to deliver our objectives so being willing to lend a helping hand goes a long way



 You won't like this role if you…

Struggle to communicate - explaining why is often as important as being right
Are uncomfortable with uncertainty - we deal with risk and uncertainty every day and have to make calculated judgements with incomplete information
Are a perfectionist - the world is a complex place and often 'perfect' solutions do not exist
Can not work as part of a team - to be successful in this role you will need to leverage the skills and experience of other team members



 Let's talk about what's in it for you
 We'll pay you between £50,000 and £70,000, depending on your specific skills and experience. If your expectations are a little different, have a chat with us!
 We keep our pay ranges broad on purpose to give us, and you, flexibility to match your experience to our zero carbon mission.
 You'll be eligible for an on-target bonus of 15%. We have one OVO bonus plan that focuses on the collective performance of our people to deliver our Plan Zero goal.
 We also offer plenty of green benefits and progressive policies to help you feel like you belong at OVO…and there's flex pay. It's an extra 9% of your salary on top of your core pay to use as you like. You can take it as cash, add to your pension, or choose to spend it on a huge range of flex benefits.   Here's a taster of what's on offer:

Our People Team can tell you everything you need to know.
 For your Belonging
 To find better ways to support our people, we need to listen to each other's experiences and find ways to build a truly inclusive and diverse workplace.

 Selection process details


       This vacancy is using Success Profiles (opens in a new window), and will assess your Behaviours, Strengths and Experience.
     



 We are for everyone
 At DLUHC we value diversity and inclusion and actively encourage and welcome applications from everyone, including those that are underrepresented in our workforce. We promote equality of opportunity in all aspects of employment and a working environment free from discrimination, harassment, bullying and victimisation.
 We would strongly recommend that applicants get in touch with the vacancy manager to find out more information about this role.
 We are for everyone
 DLUHC want to bring in a diverse workforce at all levels.
 Our application system is designed to remove as much bias as possible from the recruitment system – this means that a hiring manager does not know your name, your details, see your whole application in one go (or have your CV at review stage unless stated otherwise).
 Your answers are randomised and chunked up. This means that each assessor views sets of responses to questions for example all candidates’ responses to ‘Seeing the Big Picture’ rather than seeing a candidate’s full application. The science behind this is that recruitment can be subject to ordering and fatigue effects and we want to reduce this as much as possible.
 Most of our campaigns utilise multiple assessors and so it is possible that each of your answers would be viewed by different assessors.
 When writing your application, remember:

 The assessor won’t be reading your answers sequentially.
 Do not assume that the same assessors will have read all of your answers.
 If talking about something in your first answer, make sure that you write the second answer as if you had not written the first (and so on!)

 At sift, we will be assessing
 Experience (Lead Criteria): What experience have you had in presenting complex datasets to different audiences?
 Behaviour: Seeing the Big Picture
 Behaviour: Changing and Improving
 Behaviour: Delivering at Pace
 There is a 250 word limit per question.
 In the event that we receive a large number of applications, we may conduct an initial sift using the lead behaviour listed in the advert. Candidates who pass the initial sift may be progressed to a full sift, or progress straight to assessment/interview
 The interview will be of a blended nature consisting of the following success profiles elements:
 Behaviours: Seeing the Big Picture, Changing and Improving, Delivering at Pace
 Experience
 Strengths
 The strength based questions will require natural responses from the candidates.
 In the full campaign we will test the below Success Profile Elements:
 Behaviours: Seeing the Big Picture, Changing and Improving, Delivering at Pace
 Experience: Yes
 Strengths: Yes
 We do not consider direct CV applications to our Recruitment mailbox – you must apply for this role via the application link on Civil Service Jobs
 Please note that near miss offers may be made at the lower grade to candidates who do not meet the grade criteria for this campaign.
 HEO salary

 The salary for this role is £33,875 (London) or £30,792 (National).

The Cabinet Office then processes this data and discloses a limited dataset back to DLUHC as a participating government organisations. DLUHC then carry out the pre employment checks so as to detect instances where known fraudsters are attempting to reapply for roles in the civil service. In this way, the policy is ensured and the repetition of internal fraud is prevented.

  Tessian protects every business’s mission by securing the human layer
 


 The Tessian Cloud Email Security platform helps enterprises defend against email attacks, protect against data loss and respond to security incidents more efficiently. By combining artificial intelligence with an understanding of employee email behavior, Tessian is able to prevent complex email attacks and data loss incidents that evade Secure Email Gateways and the built in security controls of M365 and Google Workspace.
 


 The world's largest banks, healthcare organizations, hedge funds and law firms all use Tessian to secure their email environments, data and people whilst saving their security team time. In 2022 alone, Tessian prevented hundreds of thousands of business email compromise attacks, data loss incidents and saved hundreds of hours of work for security teams.
 


 Tessian is headquartered in London and Boston with 200+ employees globally and has raised over $120m in venture capital funding from world leading investors like Sequoia, Accel, Balderton, March, Citi and Okta. Tessian was recognized as one of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies for 2022. More information can be found at www.tessian.com.
 


 Data Science at Tessian



 Our mission is to secure the human layer. This involves deploying near real-time machine learning models at massive scale to some of the world’s largest organisations to keep their most sensitive data private and secure. To do this, we're looking for a senior data scientist with NLP experience ready to work on hard problems, drive best practice and cultivate an environment of experimentation and learning.
 


 Companies can leverage data science in a number of ways, and we think the role of a Data Scientist falls into three distinct categories:
 

   1) You work for a business function analysing & reporting on how to improve a key metric, e.g increasing user conversion
 

   2) You are responsible for writing production models to enhance the main product, e.g recommendation systems for e-commerce
 

   3) You build the product - without machine learning, it wouldn't exist
 


 The Data Science team built the product at Tessian. We couldn't exist without our machine learning models; they are at the heart of what we do, and they are what our clients rely on day-to-day. We're searching for a Senior Data Scientist who is excited about the opportunities and challenges that come with researching, building and deploying real-time production models.
 
 On a day to day basis you'll get to

 Work across massive enterprise email datasets
 Train and deploy models to production that impacts directly our customers and products
 Improve our ML workflow
 Work closely with our Engineering and Product Team to enhance our products.
 Make your mark on ambitious projects 

We'd love to meet someone who

 4+ years Data Science experience
 Can balance longer term projects alongside impactful quick wins
 Cares deeply about the impact their team has
 Is creative at heart, and can encourage novel ways of thinking in their team. This has always been a core part of the data science team’s DNA
 Reads Rules of Machine Learning - Martin Zinkevich and it resonates with how they think about machine learning and data science
 Enjoys “getting their hands dirty” by digging into complex operations
 Takes responsibility for delivering large projects that require collaboration from start to finish
 Has strong listening skills; open to input from other team members and departments
 Has worked with, or understands the principles behind working with data at scale


   If you're not sure that you exactly fit all of the above criteria, please do get in touch anyway. We're always willing to speak to great candidates even if you don't feel you meet every criteria listed!
  




  Tessian is an equal opportunity employer, committed to equality and diversity amongst both our employees and prospective applicants. The Human Layer we're securing is diverse, and we know we need to be diverse and inclusive to successfully create HLS that reflects this. You can read our equality and diversity statement here.
 


 As part of our commitment to equality and diversity, we're also a corporate member of the WISE Campaign for gender equality in STEM & we're a founding member of the WEDS network driving diversity & inclusion in startups.
 


 By submitting your application to Tessian, you consent to Tessian retaining your information and contacting you about future job opportunities, that may be of interest, for up to 2 years in accordance with our Privacy Policy

 Selection process details


       This vacancy is using Success Profiles (opens in a new window), and will assess your Behaviours and Experience.
     



 We are for everyone

 At DLUHC we value diversity and inclusion and actively encourage and welcome applications from everyone, including those that are underrepresented in our workforce. We promote equality of opportunity in all aspects of employment and a working environment free from discrimination, harassment, bullying and victimisation.

 We would strongly recommend that applicants get in touch with the vacancy manager to find out more information about this role.

 We are for everyone

 DLUHC want to bring in a diverse workforce at all levels.

 Our application system is designed to remove as much bias as possible from the recruitment system – this means that a hiring manager does not know your name, your details, see your whole application in one go (or have your CV at review stage unless stated otherwise).

 Your answers are randomised and chunked up. This means that each assessor views sets of responses to questions for example all candidates’ responses to ‘Seeing the Big Picture’ rather than seeing a candidate’s full application. The science behind this is that recruitment can be subject to ordering and fatigue effects and we want to reduce this as much as possible.

 Most of our campaigns utilise multiple assessors and so it is possible that each of your answers would be viewed by different assessors.

 When writing your application, remember:

 The assessor won’t be reading your answers sequentially.
 Do not assume that the same assessors will have read all of your answers.
 If talking about something in your first answer, make sure that you write the second answer as if you had not written the first (and so on!)


 At sift, we will be assessing

 Experience (lead criteria) - What experience have you had in presenting complex datasets to different audiences?

 Behaviour 1 - Seeing the big picture

 Behaviour 2 - Changing and Improving

 Behaviour 3 - Delivering at Pace

 There is a 250 word limit per question.

 In the event that we receive a large number of applications, we may conduct an initial sift using the lead behaviour listed in the advert. Candidates who pass the initial sift may be progressed to a full sift, or progress straight to assessment/interview

 The interview will be of a blended nature consisting of the following success profiles elements:
 Behaviour
 Experience
 Strength
 The strength based questions will require natural responses from the candidates.

 In the full campaign we will test the below Success Profile Elements:

 Behaviours: (Seeing the big picture, Changing and Improving, Delivering at Pace)
 Experience: (Yes)
 Strengths: (Yes)

 We do not consider direct CV applications to our Recruitment mailbox – you must apply for this role via the application link on Civil Service Jobs
 Please note that near miss offers may be made at the lower grade to candidates who do not meet the grade criteria for this campaign.

 SEO salary

 The salary for this role is £40,390 - £47,317 (London) or £37,064 - £44,099 (National) depending on the proficiency level assessment.
 For applicants in receipt of existing allowances, we will assess each case individually and attempt to match the digital allowance implemented with no detriment.
 For existing civil servants, the usual policy on level transfer and promotion will apply and is non-negotiable.

 BENEFITS:
 Transfers across the Civil Service on or after 4 October 2018: Any move to DLUHC from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers.

The Cabinet Office then processes this data and discloses a limited dataset back to DLUHC as a participating government organisations. DLUHC then carry out the pre employment checks so as to detect instances where known fraudsters are attempting to reapply for roles in the civil service. In this way, the policy is ensured and the repetition of internal fraud is prevented.

ABOUT ZENOBE
 Our goal is to make clean power accessible, to accelerate the shift to zero carbon power and transport.
 We’re building and operating the world’s most sophisticated battery systems to enable the take up of more renewable power, electrifying fleets for cleaner air, repurposing electric vehicle batteries for clean portable power and creating proprietary software and data analysis to optimise operational performance for our customers.
 Today we have 425 MW of operational and under construction grid scale battery capacity and are the largest owner and operator of EV buses in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. Zenobe is expanding into other markets such as the USA. In our first five years we have raised nearly £1billion in funding and our rapidly growing company is looking for highly talented and motivated people to join us.
 THE OPPORTUNITY
 We are looking for a talented Data Scientist to join our Modelling unit within the broader Commercial Analytics group. The candidate will be part of a new unit aimed at providing top quality modelling insights to extract the maximum value from Zenobē’s assets. 
The goal of this unit is to exploit the use of mathematical programming techniques and machine learning to optimise different aspects of the business. You will work closely with the Network Infrastructure, the EV Fleet, and the Revenue Optimisation units. Therefore, you will have exposure to different parts of the Commercial Analytics business (battery and fleet optimisation, trading, etc) always from a modelling perspective (this is not an operational role). 
This is a great opportunity for someone looking to expand their modelling skills in Python (although some other languages are used here and there) as well as getting significant exposure to other stakeholders who can help design more useful tools.
 A TASTE OF THE DAY TO DAY
 Responsible for the development of modelling tools which will be used across the Commercial Analytics and the broader company, this may include:

Developing new models with a specific purpose.
Improving existing models (e.g., introducing new markets to the current trading models).
Writing unit tests for the models and collaborating with DevOps and Data Engineering to deploy them.
Transforming scripts into coherent pieces of software.
Supporting the rest of Commercial Analytics in their modelling endeavours (e.g., providing advice, or making sure coding practices are up to the highest standards).
Collaborating with other teams at Zenobē to provide them with models and tech advice.
Teaching coding and DevOps good practices to other modellers in Commercial Analytics and other Python users in the wider company.

WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR
 We realise that certain groups of people are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t meet 100% of the job requirements. To be absolutely clear: if you like the look of this job and think you could do it well, we encourage you to apply with a CV that highlights your transferable skills and experience. Above all, Zenobē is looking for collaborative, flexible, empathetic people who are interested in creating and promoting practical routes to a zero carbon world.
 The ideal candidate will have a keen interest for the advancement of clean energy in the context of the energy transition, as well as for modelling, programming, and DevOps.
 The ideal candidate must have:

Degree in a relevant area such as electrical engineering, computer science, physics, or other quantitative and modelling focused degrees.
3+ years of experience with Python (good coding practices are a must).
Modelling experience (e.g., classical optimisation, mathematical programming, machine learning).
Competent with DevOps tools (at least two of these: git, Python environments, docker, AWS).
Willing to learn and contribute to the Modelling unit as well as the Commercial Analytics team.
Experience developing in teams.

In addition, knowledge in one or more areas below would be of value:

Excellent DevOps competencies (docker, git, CI/CD, AWS)
Good git practices (e.g., gitflow, pull requests)
Experience with mathematical programming (LP, MILP)
Experience with machine learning common libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch)
Experience with visualisation tools such as Dash, Grafana, Streamlit

WORKING AT ZENOBE
 We’re passionate about sustainability and are proud to offer Team Zenobē a pioneering and collaborative working environment. We encourage our people to take ownership of their career progression and celebrate those that can think outside the box.
 If you’d like to join our community of likeminded people hit the apply button now, we’d love to hear from you!

25 days holiday, plus bank holidays
Private Medical Insurance, for you and the family
£1500 training budget per year, to ensure you grow as we do

Plus more

Lots of our people work flexibly in many different ways, including part-time, flexitime and hybrid working. We can’t promise to give you exactly what you want, but please talk to us about the flexibility you need and let’s see how we can make it work.
 OUR APPROACH TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute.

459ccd3813c50a9a,Customer Data Scientist - job post,"Up to £40,000 a year","
At Flexciton, we are leading the 4th industrial revolution by bringing A.I. to manufacturing. We build on pioneering research to completely revolutionise the way the manufacturing industry operates. Whilst only a young startup, we work with some of the largest and most advanced manufacturers in the world!
 We are here to transform the way the largest companies in the world make their products, by building a platform that is solving an extremely difficult problem - one that would be impossible for a human to solve.
 Our vision is to bring Flexciton optimization technology to every factory in the world to enable manufacturing to operate at a level never before possible.
 About the role
 Welcome to the Customer team. We are a small group of 5 customer experts and engineers that moonlight as consultants for our client projects and we're looking to rapidly expand by bringing on a few more passionate practitioners.
 We're building software to improve semiconductor wafer fabs. Your job will be to work with clients on the smooth rollout of our software through your expert data, communication, and collaboration skills. You may be working on more than one customer at a time depending on your workload so hopefully you like a fair bit of variety. After rollout, your job will be to maximise the success and satisfaction our software brings the customer. So, if you want to be part of a high-performing team solving difficult problems using equal-parts data analytics and customer interaction you've come to the right place!
 What you’ll be doing
 You will thrive in this varied and challenging role as you take on:

 Making sense of live, messy semiconductor data to discover things we never knew about our customers.
 Becoming an expert in a few chosen customers. You'll know their requirements inside-out and be our go-to specialist within the company.
 Engaging with early stage pre-sales projects. You'll meet new prospective clients before anyone else and help shape our company's future towards their needs from the very first call.
 Prototyping new software features to iterate with clients quickly, and customising the full-stack of our application to suit specific clients’ needs. You’ll be making changes to our entire codebase so hopefully you don’t mind getting stuck into some aspects of software that are currently foreign to you. We work with Python, Angular, and Kubernetes to name a few technologies in our software stack.
 Being a dedicated point of contact for your customers and their ""voice"" to the rest of our company; making sure our product works for their needs. You'll also practise ""customer evangelism"" by teaching others internally about them and what makes them tick. Bonus points if you can do that using Slack emojis.
 You'll be client-facing; speaking to customers multiple times throughout the week, and be curious about their needs. You'll empathise with the root of their problems without jumping to early conclusions.
 Understanding all the knobs and dials on our software. You'll be demo'ing brand new features and troubleshooting customer issues by staying up-to-date on the inner workings of our app
 There's not many semiconductor fabs in central London so hopefully you don't mind a plane trip to Europe or the US. Travel will be a key part of the role, so we practice fly-home-Fridays. Trips will happen about once per month and the vast majority of the time you'll be back in London by Thursday night, and only be gone a few days of the week.


 What we are looking for in you

 Commercial experience of 6 months to a year in a similar role
 You can pick up difficult concepts very quickly
 Strong Excel, Business Intelligence skills ie SQL
 Commercial experience of 6 months to a year with Python, R, or similar
 Willingness to learn small amounts of Angular, Kubernetes, Docker, and other full-stack tooling, if you don’t already have experience in this
 Strong aptitude for data and how tables fit together
 Willing to travel internationally
 Strong self-management and delivery skills
 You're proactive and take initiative; you happily take ownership of tasks and workstreams.
 Interested in becoming an expert in the world of semiconductor


 What you’ll achieve in your first 3-6 / 12 months:

 Deliver a few production-grade engineering features
 Learn about the full-stack of our application including how it’s deployed
 Work on early-stage Proof of Concept projects including deploying new instances of our app for those clients
 Become an expert in our product, how it's used, and how it works
 Travel to the site of one or more of these customers to gather requirements
 Analyse data from the client sites for the purpose of understanding product requirements and user stories

 Interview Process
 Stage 1 - Recruiter Screen with Talent Partner
 Stage 2 - Data Analytics presentation followed by Q&A with two members of the Customer Team
 Stage 3 - Tech stage interview - paired programming with two members of the Customer Team
 Stage 4 - Final stage interview with two members of the Senior Leadership Team

 Benefits

 We are paying up to £40,000 per annum based on skills and experience
 Stock Options so when we make it big - so do you!
 L&D Opportunities 
We are determined to continuously develop ourselves, our company and our teams. We have a £500 training allowance for every employee. We also have our mini library where we keep adding books every week. We want to be able to create as many opportunities for our teams' growth .
 Hybrid working model of 3 days in the office (Monday, Tuesdays and Fridays) and 2 days working from home.
 Breakfasts and Snacks Our office is stocked with snacks, drinks, fruits, cereal.
 Monthly lunches in the office
 Quarterly team activity or dinner .
 Annual Team Trip Every year, we take our team to an annual retreat where we have strategy workshops, foster our culture and do lots of fun activities.
 Additional day of holiday every year (up to 30 days) after two years of service.
 Discounts with Charlie HR perks Get discounts on brands, cinema tickets, shopping, travel and many more!
 Season Ticket Loan/Cycle to Work Scheme 
2 Weeks Work From Anywhere Policy 

Why join us
 We’re still a young startup (~45 employees, ~70% engineers) but we’re at an inflection point. Our software is running live and providing gains in a world class semiconductor factory and we will soon be scaling to many more. We are expecting to grow the engineering team several fold in the coming years so this is an extremely exciting time to join. If you’re not interested in writing yet another CRUD app and are looking for some unique challenges and complex problems to solve then this is the place for you.
 We were recently voted one of the world’s most disruptive companies on the Disrupt 100 List and are well funded with the aim to take even more funding in the coming months to support our ambitious growth plan. Our biggest asset, though, is our people. We have an open culture where everyone’s opinion is heard and everyone has the opportunity to shape the future of our technology. At our size, every developer is crucial and has a big impact on our final product.
 Finally, we are having a big impact on the world. The factories we optimise create things that are all around us. They’re in the device you’re reading this on and countless other devices in your home. They’re used in healthcare, aviation, automotive, robotics, communications, IoT and many more and they’re in limited supply making our software even more vital to our customers who are under pressure to increase output. In short, there’s never been a better time to join Flexciton.
 At Flexciton, we value diversity and foster an inclusive environment. We are committed to equal employment opportunity and we want to ensure that our recruitment process is accessible to everyone. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation during the process, please do not hesitate to let us know.

 Why Consumer Healthcare?

 Right now, we’re on an incredible journey as we prepare to become the first independent, 100% focused consumer healthcare company. We’re doing this at a time when the work we do has never mattered more. Better everyday health is about improving the health and wellness of the consumers that we touch every year – over a billion and a half of them – and it goes beyond products. It’s about truly helping people manage their health proactively in different ways as consumer needs evolve.

 With category leading brands such as Sensodyne, Voltaren and Centrum, built on trusted science and human understanding, and combined with our passion, knowledge and expertise, we’re uniquely placed to do this and to grow a strong, successful business.

 This is an exciting time to join us and help shape the future. It’s an opportunity to be part of something special.

 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

 In Consumer Healthcare we embrace our diverse workforce by creating an inclusive environment that celebrates our unique perspectives, generates curiosity to create unmatched understanding of each other, and promotes fair and equitable outcomes for everyone.

 We’re striving to create a climate where we celebrate our diversity in all forms by treating each other with respect, listening to different viewpoints, supporting our communities, and creating a workplace where your authentic self belongs and thrives

 Location

 Recently we’ve shared some exciting proposals with our colleagues which mark an important moment in our preparations for separation and becoming a new, standalone Consumer Healthcare company.

 Our preparations are going well. GSK is on track to separate in mid-2022 and create two incredible new companies, each with the ability to improve the health of millions of patients and consumers worldwide, and both great places to work.

 We’ve already confirmed that our new Consumer Healthcare company will be headquartered in the UK and the first step we’re taking is to announce proposals to move our CH business from our current location in GSK House in Brentford when we separate, into a new, CH headquarters in Weybridge. This will be a temporary, but important move in the short term, whilst we take this opportunity to design for the future and create an inspiring, flexible, collaborative workspace that meets the changing needs of our people and our business needs.

 Inspired by our new culture and purpose, and with a commitment to our sustainability goals, we plan to build a new campus close by which would be home to our headquarters teams, our UK business, our global Oral Health category, R&D and innovation teams, as well as a state-of-the-art Shopper Science lab.

 The current and future success of the New GSK and New CH business is due in large part to the talent that resides in each organization. To ensure stability in the lead up to Separation, individuals who are currently dedicated to either business (New GSK or New CH) will not be able to apply for roles in the other business (including employees in the Global Support Functions and the Corporate Functions) prior to Separation, unless where their role has been placed at risk of redundancy. An exception process is in place, however cases in which exceptions would be made are expected to be rare (e.g. where a new role represents a significant promotion opportunity). You must therefore discuss this with your line manager before submitting an application.

 #TechConsumer

 As a company driven by our values of Patient focus, Transparency, Respect and Integrity, we know inclusion and diversity are essential for us to be able to succeed. We want all our colleagues to thrive at GSK bringing their unique experiences, ensuring they feel good and to keep growing their careers. As a candidate for a role, we want you to feel the same way.

 As an Equal Opportunity Employer, we are open to all talent. In the US, we also adhere to Affirmative Action principles. This ensures that all qualified applicants will receive equal consideration for employment without regard to race/ethnicity, colour, national origin, religion, gender, pregnancy, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, age, disability, genetic information, military service, covered/protected veteran status or any other federal, state or local protected class*(*US only).

 We believe in an agile working culture for all our roles. If flexibility is important to you, we encourage you to explore with our hiring team what the opportunities are.

 Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you’d like to discuss any adjustments to our process which might help you demonstrate your strengths and capabilities. You can either call us on 0808 234 4391, or send an email ukdiversity.recruitment@gsk.com

 As you apply, we will ask you to share some personal information which is entirely voluntary. We want to have an opportunity to consider a diverse pool of qualified candidates and this information will assist us in meeting that objective and in understanding how well we are doing against our inclusion and diversity ambitions. We would really appreciate it if you could take a few moments to complete it. Rest assured, Hiring Managers do not have access to this information and we will treat your information confidentially.

Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.
 




     About the role:
   





       Staff Data Scientists serve both as technical individual contributors and people mentors. You will be responsible for owning a technical area as well as building and nurturing a team.
     


       Staff Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
     


       Staff Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and direct people-management, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
     







 Who we are looking for:
   





       You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful AI-based projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
     


       You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution.
     


       You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
     








       You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.

       You are accustomed to start-up culture. You embrace risks, make smart investments, be agile when priorities shifted.
     


       You work with confidence and without ego. Our research data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
     


       You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
     


       You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need research data scientists who know all the answers; we need research data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
     







 What you bring to the AI Lab:
   





       You are jack-of-all-trade and master of some in the field of AI. Ideally, you have 5+ years of experience working with AI-related research and applications. You may have an advanced degree in a CS/AI field, but it’s not a strict requirement. What and how you can contribute is what’s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
     


       You have a track record of turning the latest AI publications into solutions for exotic real world problems or ideas for novel product creation. You are up to date regarding the latest advancements in AI.
     


       You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
     








       You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
     


       You have strong programming and big data processing skills, with experience of making machine learning or data mining algorithms work on massive amount of data. Python, Scala and Spark are example languages we use for R&D, but we are not restricted to them.
     


       Deep expertise and extensive hands-on experiences in some of the following areas is a plus:
     


NLP/NLU and Conversational AI technologies (e.g., chatbots)
Deep Learning and Graph ML






Knowledge engineering and symbolic-based ML

    We began our journey in 2005 with the drive to deliver customer-first financial products. Fast forward to 2020, we shifted gears and became a digital bank, leveraging our customer knowledge, money expertise and technical agility to forge ahead. Our diverse team is united by a mission to create simple, fair and honest financial products that have the customers’ needs at their heart. 
  



   We’re regularly recognised at industry awards for our game-changing products and are proud to be one of the market leaders in consumer lending in the UK. But our work doesn’t stop there. 
  



   After securing £220 million in our 2021 funding round led by SoftBank, we’ve entered the next stage in our journey. So far, we’ve lent out over £8 billion and made money work better for over half a million people across the UK who were looking to borrow or save with us. In less than 2 years after becoming a bank, we hit £2 billion in customer deposits and we’re also a top 5 credit card issuer in the UK. And this is just the beginning.
  



    We’re set on achieving big things with ambitious growth targets to match. This means there's a range of opportunities for you to excel and develop through a career at Zopa, while building better banking products that truly matter to our customers.

 At Zopa, data and the application of machine learning is at the heart of what we do and the products we bring to market. Within consumer financial services we have pioneered modern data science techniques using advanced ML models for more than 7 years. Today more than 98% of our lending decisions are driven by ML models - so it's safe to say it is seriously impactful work!
  


 We're constantly innovating and using new techniques; recently we deployed deep learning models to assess credit risk with a current focus being the interpretability and explainability of our models (read about our work with AWS team here).

c65a366f9a6e6d51,Machine Learning Researcher - job post,,"
Location : London
G-Research is Europe’s leading quantitative finance research firm. We hire the brightest minds in the world to tackle some of the biggest questions in finance. We pair this expertise with machine learning, big data, and some of the most advanced technology available to predict movements in financial markets.

The role

Machine Learning is an integral part of G-Research’s work. We use applied ML techniques to develop successful investment management strategies; it is one of the core drivers of our overall performance and success. ML has long been a key tool at G-Research and we count among our number a range of ICML and NeurIPS published researchers.

Joining our leading ML team, you will have huge amounts of (clean) data and massive compute at your fingertips, with which you will predict the future of financial markets. Because this is a very mature prediction problem, finding the 1% of difference, working at the very cutting edge of developments, is the place where success happens. You will, in effect, be incentivised to explore the state-of-the-art.

While we start with the standard ML toolkit, to make a model work our researchers really need to understand what’s going on, not just throw an out-of-the-box solution at a dataset. This involves applying machine learning methods drawn from diverse areas such as neural networks, reinforcement learning, deep learning, non-convex optimisation, Bayesian non-parametrics, NLP and approximate inference. Unlike pure problems, our researchers get near-instantaneous feedback on their work in the form of absolute numbers: success is highly measurable and has direct impact on the business.

As a team, we read the latest publications in the field and discuss them within the firm’s vibrant research community and attend the leading conferences worldwide (e.g. NeurIPS, ICML, ACL etc.).

In this research role you will be able to develop and test your ideas with real-world data in an environment that resembles academia.

Who are we looking for?

The ideal candidate will at a minimum have experience in the following areas:

 Either a post-graduate degree in machine learning or a related discipline, or commercial experience developing novel machine learning algorithms. We will also consider exceptional candidates with a proven record of success in online data science competitions (e.g. Kaggle).
 Experience in one or more of deep learning, reinforcement learning, non-convex optimisation, Bayesian non-parametrics, NLP or approximate inference.
 Excellent reasoning skills and mathematical ability are crucial: off the shelf methods don’t always work on our data so you will need to understand how to develop your own models.
 Strong programming skills and experience working with Python, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks is desirable. Experience with object oriented programming would be beneficial.
 Publications at top conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR etc. is highly desirable.


Why should you apply?

 Highly competitive compensation plus annual discretionary bonus
 Lunch provided (via Just Eat for Business) and dedicated barista bar
 30 days’ annual leave
 9% company pension contributions
 Informal dress code and excellent work/life balance
 Comprehensive healthcare and life assurance
 Cycle-to-work scheme
 Monthly company events

G-Research is committed to cultivating and preserving an inclusive work environment. We are an ideas-driven business and we place great value on diversity of experience and opinions.
We want to ensure that applicants receive a recruitment experience that enables them to perform at their best. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation please let us know in the relevant section.

We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.
 


   Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.
 


   We are looking for Senior Data Scientists to join the markets team. In markets, we build innovative products to ensure advertisers are buying media as efficiently as possible, design algorithms to regulate ad spend while balancing pre-negotiated contracts and KPI performance, and conduct fundamental research on forecasting and planning that will shift the ad buying paradigm in TV.
 


   WHAT YOU WILL DO
 

 Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, delivering and monitoring data-focused products for our clients.
 Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring and technical leadership, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
 Depending on the team, you may either be working with advanced statistical models on complex data, cutting edge ML models or recommendation engines to optimize ad performance.
 In this team you will work on the development and productionisation of ETLs and data science models (statistical/ML/optimisation/recommendation) that operate on truly big data.
 You will also build prototypes to prove the idea and advise engineers to build up dashboards as well as reporting and measurement capabilities using Vertica as our data warehouse.



   WHO YOU ARE:
 

 You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
 You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
 You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.
 You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
 You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
 You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
 You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.



   WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:
 

 You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
 You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
 You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
 You have over 6 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it’s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what’s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
 You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
